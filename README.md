# 🏦 Banking Dashboard Project

This repository showcases a complete data analysis and dashboarding project based on a banking dataset. It includes EDA, visualization, and design components to present insights in an intuitive and interactive manner.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA using Python to:

- Understand data distributions and key statistics
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Explore patterns in customer demographics, loans, and deposits
- Visualize key insights using libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive 5-page dashboard was created in Power BI:

1. **Home Page** – Overview with visuals and navigation
2. **Loan Analysis** – Customer loan patterns and insights
3. **Deposit Analysis** – Behavior and trends related to deposits
4. **Summary** – Consolidated key metrics and KPIs
5. **QnA** – Power BI Q&A for natural language queries

## 🎨 Visual Design with Canva

To enhance the visual appeal and consistency of the dashboard, Canva was used for:

- Custom banners and graphics
- Design elements on the homepage
- Aesthetic layout inspiration for dashboard sections

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Power BI**
- **Canva**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📌 Objective

This project is a part of my learning journey in data analysis and dashboard development. It combines technical skills, storytelling, and design to communicate data insights effectively.
